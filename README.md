- Calculate the middle index as mid = (low + high) / 2.
- Check if arr[mid] is a peak element (greater than or equal to both neighbors). If true, print and return.
- If the left neighbor is greater (arr[mid-1] > arr[mid]), recursively search in the left half (low to mid-1).
- Otherwise, search in the right half (mid+1 to high).
- Repeat the process until a peak element is found and return the value.

- If arr[j] > arr[j+1], swap the two elements.
- After each outer loop pass, the largest element is placed at the end.
- Repeat the process until no swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.

- Repeat until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity:

- Partition the array such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left, and those larger are on the right.
- Place the pivot in its correct sorted position.
- Recursively apply the same steps to the sub-arrays to the left and right of the pivot.
- Repeat until the sub-arrays contain only one element or are empty (base case).

Time Complexity:
    Best Case - O(n log n) // When the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal sub array

### Problem 1.
Given an integer n, the task is to find the solution to the n-queens problem, where n queens are placed on an n*n chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.

#### Algorithm: 
1.	Start with column 1 and try placing a queen in each row of that column.
2.	For each row, check if placing a queen there is safe (no other queen in the same row, main diagonal, or anti-diagonal).
3.	If safe, place the queen and mark the row and diagonals as occupied.
4.	Recur to place the queen in the next column.
5.	If a solution is found (column > n), store the current configuration.
6.	Backtrack: remove the queen and unmark the row and diagonals.
7.	Repeat until all solutions are explored.

#### Output:
Enter the value of n

### Problem 2.
Given two strings, the task is to find the length of their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), which is the longest sequence that appears in the same relative order (but not necessarily contiguous) in both strings.

#### Algorithm: 
1.	Initialize a 2D DP Table c[m+1][n+1] where m and n are the lengths of the two strings.
2.	Fill the DP Table: If characters match, c[i][j] = 1 + c[i-1][j-1]. Otherwise, c[i][j] = max(c[i-1][j], c[i][j-1]).
3.	Track the Directions using a table b[m+1][n+1] to store:
o	"↖" for diagonal (match),
o	"⬆" for up (skip from top),
o	"⬅" for left (skip from left).
4.	Backtrack from b[m][n] to print the LCS:
o	If b[m][n] = "↖", include the character and move diagonally.
o	If b[m][n] = "⬆", move up (skip current character of str1).
o	If b[m][n] = "⬅", move left (skip current character of str2).
5.	Print the Final LCS after backtracking.

#### Output:
```
Enter the two string

### Problem 1.
(Graph Coloring) Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine all possible ways to assign colors to each vertex such that:
•	No two adjacent vertices share the same color.
•	At most m colors are used.


#### Algorithm:
1.	Use a recursive function solve() to try assigning colors to each node starting from the first.
2.	For each node, attempt to assign a color from 1 to m.
3.	Before assigning, check with isSafe() to ensure no adjacent node has the same color.
4.	If safe, assign the color and recursively move to the next node.
5.	If a coloring is completed (all nodes colored), store the solution.
6.	Use backtracking to try different color combinations.
7.	Print all valid colorings or report if none exist.


#### Output:
```
